      Using peer-to-peer technologies for music

    <notes>immaterial.cloud is an immersive audiovisual installation that explores a possible networked future of
      peer-to-peer technologies, away from cloud computing. Participants experience the work via two to four
      smartphones placed in different locations in a room. As participants walk up to a phone, they see a representation
      of themselves through data. If the participant gets close enough, the phone trig- gers a change in the sound of
      immaterial.cloud and the other phones follow.</notes>

    Attention Economy

    <notes>

      What is attention and why is it important? Attention is conscious processing of in- formation from intentionally
      chosen sources [44]. Attention is a scarce resource, which is to say, “The exposure of subjects to signals is so
      strong that having an impact by absorb- ing part of their attention capacity requires to send strong signals and
      to target them on audiences with relatively exhausted perception capacity [34].” Many attentional senders compete
      for the attention of receivers with limited attention capacity. The way we pay attention is changing because of
      addictive technologies.

      Attention can be divided into types, transitory attention is often involuntary and fleet- ing while sustained
      attention is voluntary and longer lasting [100]. Hyper attention is a further demarcation discussed by N.
      Katherine Hayles and is “characterized by switch- ing focus rapidly among different tasks, preferring multiple
      information streams, seeking a high level of stimulation, and having a low tolerance for boredom [45].” Hyper
      attention is transitory attention for the digital age.

    <notes>
      Perhaps a more familiar example of the attention economy would be Google Search. Figure 2.1 shows an example of a
      recent search where Google Search predicted search results based on my browsing history on Google Books then
      automatically made available to Google Search, allowing the prediction to happen. The perniciousness of this is
      that this prediction is a useful tool, and most users won’t take the time to stop and analyze how it works. They
      will just enjoy the ease of use that data sharing has given them, without thinking about the consequences in loss
      of privacy.

    Alternatives?

    <notes>
      How can the attention economy be resisted? We must re- design the technologies that encourage a capitalist percep-
      tion of time, place, self, and community. Deepening one’s concept of place will extend an awareness of history and
      cur- rent connection to everything around them. Odell suggests that “doing nothing” moves our attention from
      economic concerns to the physical, place based domain [18]. Doing nothing, or sitting out the attention economy is
      an active proposition and “entails an active process of listening that seeks out the effects of racial,
      environmental, and economic injustice and brings about real change [18].”

      Because of these platforms’ flaws we shouldn’t be using them to distribute and make our art. These platforms re-
      ward a way of being that isn’t beneficial to society. They resist the concept of interconnection, by emphasizing
      our differences and not allowing us to show fuller versions of ourselves. We must “stand apart”[18] as Odell
      suggests, and create new systems for communication on the internet.
      How can we regain attention? One way is through art, another through nature. Conceptual art encourages a per-
      ception of time on different scales and tempos and allows for deep attention.

    Attention Restoration Theory (ART)

    <div>
      <em> Rachel and Stephen Kaplan </em>
    </div>

    <notes>
      Interacting with nature can also restore our attention. Psychologist Kaplan found that the natural envi- ronment
      aids in stress reduction by providing a “restorative environment” that reduces the fatigue caused by directed
      attention [9]. Attention Restoration Theory (ART) claims that we use directed attention in our daily lives to
      function. Sustained directed attention leads to cognitive depletion and mental fatigue [10]. Kaplan didn’t mention
      sound directly in his research, but a recent study by Ratcliffe has extended Kaplan’s research to show that
      certain bird sounds may pro- vide restorative benefits [21].

    <div>VR Sequencer</div>
    <div>by Chase Mitchusson</div>
    <notes>
      This piece was an inspiration for this lesson. Chase creates a sequencer
      that is perfomed by throwing dice in VR. Multiple playheads create
      interesting polyrhythms. There is no goal for the game, just to make
      music.
